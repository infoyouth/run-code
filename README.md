## Features

- **Write and Compile**: Easily write and edit your C/C++ code in the provided text area and compile it with a click of a button.
- **Real-Time Output**: The compiler output is displayed in real-time below the code area, showing any warnings, errors, or generated executable output.
- **WebAssembly Technology**: The code is compiled on the client-side using WebAssembly, providing a fast and secure compilation process.
- **Easy to Use**: The user-friendly interface makes it accessible to beginners and experienced programmers alike.

## Getting Started

1. Visit the [Online GCC Compiler](https://infoyouth.github.io/run-code/) hosted on GitHub Pages.
2. Write or paste your C/C++ code in the text area provided.
3. Click the "Compile" button to initiate the compilation process.

## Limitations

- The online compiler supports only C and C++ languages.
- It does not support executing system calls or including external libraries.
- The compiler operates on the client-side, meaning it relies on the user's device for compilation.
